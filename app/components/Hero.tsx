        <p className="py-4">
            I'm currently working towards a Post-Bacc B.S. in Computer Science, at Oregon State University!
            Prior to that I studied Human-Computer Interaction at UC San Diego 
            focusing on UX and design, which led me to my interest in building frontend, web apps, and eventually fullstack development.

        <p className="pb-8">
            I'm always looking to improve my skillset and learn new technologies.
